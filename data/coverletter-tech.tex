Dear Sir,

I am thrilled to offer my services to help you with your firm’s upcoming challenges, in business and technology, as I would love to leverage my excelled education in MBA and computer engineering, versatile knowledge, 10 years of experience and passion for information systems and solutions. I have experience in leading successful cross-functional teams, and carefully managing IT aspects with advanced top-notch technology trends.

Throughout my career, I've worked closely with head management of multiple sectors; private, government and I-NGO, to identify and overcome business challenges from a technological perspective, by maximizing revenues via entering new markets with newly designed applications and products, also by continuously reducing costs via optimizing technical budgets and adopting affordable services through cost-benefit analysis.

During the past 7 years of my duty with Souktel Inc, I've helped my firm in seeking and forming new technologies into viable business opportunities while assuring our systems’ scalability, security and elasticity, that made it possible for us to expand our line of services and hence boosted our annual revenue to multi-million USD, and grew our team to 50+ from only 8 early-stage startup champions!

I would welcome the chance to discuss your business and/or technology objectives, and show you my proven experience in translating those into achievable action plans and practical strategical roadmap.

Sencerely,

Thabet
